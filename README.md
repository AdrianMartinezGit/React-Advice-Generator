({Great looking sight! The functionality works perfectly. Some knitpicks are some of the CSS. The Advice and Prompt aren't exactly the same color in the style guide provided. There's a lot of space above the Advice, I would take away some top padding and the Advice font size looks a little too big. When the text is too long, it doesn't go to the next line it just continues on one line. When scaling down to mobile, the font size looks too small and the button isn't placed correctly. Other than that, amazing looking website. Keep up the great work!})
